# Features
This major-mode for TLA+ has a combination of features from earlier versions made by others.
  * [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)
  * Comint-supported REPL development

# Previous Versions
There have been a variety of previous major-modes created for TLA+ in Emacs.
But, none of them seemed maintained and did not have all the features I wanted.
So, I put this major-mode together in the hopes that it is useful to me and to others.

I want to thank these previous pioneers in working on this field, in no particular order:
